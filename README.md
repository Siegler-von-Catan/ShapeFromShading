Converting Images of seals into 3D objects

Part of the Coding Da Vinci Niedersachsen 2020 Hackathon, we scan images of seals and produce 3D object out of them.

## Usage

For development, after clone, run:
```
pip install -e .
```

Now,
```
sealconvert3d [args]
```
should be available in your command line.
